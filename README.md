# Horiseon Refactor

## Description
A refactoring of an existing html/css web layout. The code for this .html webpage was made without accessibility condisiderations in mind. I reviewed information on nvaccess.org, a leading accessibility software developer, to get an idea of what portions of the code need adjustment to be compliant. I have made those adjustments, as well as comments indicating what each section of code does on the web page.

## Installation
No installation beyond a web browser should be needed to view the webpage. However, a non-visual reader, such as nvaccess.org would be required to view the accessibility details. A code editor such as visual studio is required to view the code.

## Usage
This webpage is viewable at: https://flynn0087.github.io/Horiseon_Refactor/
Here is an example image of the page:

## Contributing
As this is my first attempt at refactoring I used a more restrictive license. However, pull requests and advice are welcome. For major changes please create an issue first about the changes to be made.
